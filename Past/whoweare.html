		<h2> Who we are: </h2>
		<p> We know accessible tools for people with hearing loss are really (bleeping) expensive.  
		We also know that colleges and universities typically do not allow students to keep their FM units after graduation.  In an effort to ensure that recent graduates and young professionals get the services they need to succeed in the workplace after graduation, we have purchased a bunch of Roger Mics for the Naida Advanced Bionics system that we loan out for a period of 6 months while students and young professionals get settled in their careers and jobs.  Wan to borrow one?  Log in and check our service offerings so you can have all the tools and services you need to succeed in the workplace. </p>

		<h2> What we do: </h2>
		<p> After you register and login, you can book a Roger Pen from our ToolBase.  After you book, the pen is then sent to you via mail and you get to rent it out for 6 months from the date.  BOOM!.  WAM! KAPOW!

		<br>
		That simple.
